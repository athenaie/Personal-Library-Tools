# Libary Collection Stats and Fun Tools
This is a series of mini-projects for doing various interesting things with my books collection I have catalogued on LibraryThing.

## TBR Jar
Random selects books for me to read from my subsets of my unread collection.
This was inspired by the idea of a physical TBR jar that many avid readers have, with paper slips of books they are meaning to read.

## Stats
Various statistics about either my entire collection or subgroups of books, including pages, height of stack, number of books, etc.
